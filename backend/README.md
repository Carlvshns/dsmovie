# backendup
This is the backend of the "dsmovie" project which is also here in this profile. This repository represents exactly the same proposal as the "backend" folder in the 'dsmovie' repository. I had to make a separate repository to test my API in the cloud. My personal computer didn't support deploying through subfolders, and this was the solution I found.
